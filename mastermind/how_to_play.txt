HOW TO PLAY:
            
    Mastermind is a game of cunning and wit. The objective is simple - 
    the computer has a code and you have to break it. 

    The code consists of 4 colors in a specific order. Your goal is to guess the 
    colors in their exact order. The colors can be any one of 8 colors available
    for the computer to choose from which are as follows:
        - Red
        - Green
        - Blue
        - Yellow
        - Orange
        - Purple
        - Magenta
        - White
    The computer is allowed to repeat colors in the code, so theoretically the 
    code could just be four of the same color. You will have to figure it out 
    for yourself.

    To submit a guess, simply type in the first letter of each color, in the 
    order you believe they're arranged in the code, in the format 'RGBY', then 
    hit Enter.

    After each guess, the computer will give you feedback about how accurate 
    your guess was. For each correct color, the computer will print a '*'. 
    However if you guess the correct color in the correct position, the computer
    will print a '!'. The computer will not print anything for incorrect colors. 

    As an example, if the code were 'RGBY' and you guessed 'RBWW', the computer 
    would print a '!' for correctly guessing Red in the first position, and a 
    '*' for correctly guessing that there is a Blue in the code, but not getting 
    the position right. You can then use that feedback to influence your next 
    guess.

    You will be given 12 guesses to crack the code. If you match the code 
    exactly on any one of those guesses, you win! But if you fail to get it 
    after 12 guesses, you lose :(
        
    Good Luck!
